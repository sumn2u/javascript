# For

The easiest form of a loop is the for statement. This one has a syntax that is similar to an if statement, but with more options:

```javascript
for (condition; end condition; change) {
    // do it, do it now
}
```

Lets for example see how to execute the same code ten-times using a `for` loop:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
  // do this code ten-times
}
```

> _**Note**_: `i = i + 1` can be written `i++`.
