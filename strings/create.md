# Creation

You can define strings in JavaScript by enclosing the text in single quotes or double quotes:

```javascript
// Single quotes can be used
var str = "Our lovely string";

// Double quotes as well
var otherStr = "Another nice string";
```

In Javascript, Strings can contain UTF-8 characters:

```text
"中文 español English हिन्दी العربية português বাংলা русский 日本語 ਪੰਜਾਬੀ 한국어";
```

**Note:** Strings can not be subtracted, multiplied, or divided.
