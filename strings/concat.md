# Concatenation

Concatenation involves adding two or more strings together, creating a larger string containing the combined data of those original strings. This is done in JavaScript using the **+** operator.

```javascript
var bigStr = "Hi " + "JS strings are nice " + "and " + "easy to add";
```
