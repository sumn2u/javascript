# Creation

Creating a number is easy, it can be done just like for any other variable type using the `var` keyword.

Numbers can be created from a constant value:

```javascript
// This is a float:
var a = 1.2;

// This is an integer:
var b = 10;
```

Or from the value of another variable:

```javascript
var a = 2;
var b = a;
```
