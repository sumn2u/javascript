# Basic Operators

You can apply mathematic operations to numbers using some basic operators like:

* **Addition**: `c = a + b`
* **Subtraction**: `c = a - b`
* **Multiplication**: `c = a * b`
* **Division**: `c = a / b`

You can use parentheses just like in math to separate and group expressions: `c = (a / b) + d`
